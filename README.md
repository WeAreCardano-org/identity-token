# Identity Token

## Mission

 1. Whereas there is a need for a metadata standard for tokens that represent identity, we will identify the characteristics of an ideal version of such a standard.
 2. To these ends, we will derive inspiration from existing systems, 
 3. and we will make this as easy to use and compatable as possible.
 
## Tasks

 - [ ] Generate a list of properties.
 - [ ] Specify a JSON structure.
 - [ ] Build prototypes.
 - [ ] Ask for community feedback.
 - [ ] Write a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP).
 - [ ] Create applications that use the standard.
 - [ ] Find local partners who can pariticpate in the validation step.
 
## Features

Identity tokens must be connected to issuers who can validate the
authenticity of an ID. Issuers may be departments of motorized
vehicles (DMVs). 

## Long-term Vision

We will partner with Atala Prism and comport with their standards. We
will set up a company to provide services to local governments --
municipalities and counties in particular -- and companies whom we
will need to perform the verification service.

Genetic and biometric multisignatures will ultimately be used to
verify and issue identity tokens as it is difficult to fake tissue
when you take a biopsy. The methylation state will also be taken into
account when we become a space-faring civilization. See the "fantasy"
file for silly details.
