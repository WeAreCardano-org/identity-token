# Identity Token

## Mission

 1. Whereas there is a need for a metadata standard for tokens that represent identity, we will identify the characteristics of an ideal version of such a standard.
 2. To these ends, we will derive inspiration from existing systems, 
 3. and we will make this as easy to use and compatable as possible.
